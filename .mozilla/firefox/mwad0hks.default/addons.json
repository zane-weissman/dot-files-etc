However, the source code is free, so if you feel like giving it a shot you can totally do so!)\n\nVimFx is a Firefox extension which adds short, Vim-style keyboard shortcuts for browsing and navigation, for a near mouseless experience.\n\n    Doesn’t change your browser in any way. Everything can be disabled.\n    Easy for beginners, powerful for advanced users. Not just for Vim fanatics.\n    Modeled after Vimium for Chrome.\n\nNew to VimFx? Check out Questions & Answers!\nPower user? Make a config file!\nIn either case, have look at the the documentation and the wiki.\n\nVimFx is made by these awesome people.\n\nWhy VimFx was created\n\n    Even before Vimium there was Vimperator for Firefox. In my opinion, Vimperator has too many features and aggressively changes the default Firefox appearance and behavior. Vimium is exactly what I need in terms of added functionality, but for Chrome. That’s why I decided to develop a similar extension for Firefox.\n\n     VimFx will be nice to your browser and to your habits. Promise.\n\n    – Anton Khodakivskiy, VimFx’s original author.\n\n\nKey Features\nVimFx has concise shortcuts for most commonly performed actions. Many simply invoke standard Firefox features. That is preferred over re-implementing similar functionality.\n\nPress f to mark links, text inputs and buttons on the page. Then either type the hint or the text of a marked element to click it. This command has many variations, for example to copy links or open them in new tabs.\n\nSearch with / and cycle between matches with n and N.\n\nOpen a new tab with t, close it with x. Reopen it again with X. Switch between tabs with J and K, or some of the several other tab commands.\n\nScrolling left/down/up/right: h, j, k, l.\nTop/Bottom: gg, G.\nPage up/down: space, shift-space.\nHalf a page: d, u.\n\nUse Caret mode to copy text without using the mouse.\n\nThere are of course many more shortcuts! Press ? to see them all, and then / to search among them. Click on a command or open VimFx’s options page in the Add-ons Manager to customize the default shortcuts.\n\nYou can temporarily disable VimFx by using Ignore mode. Press i to enter it, and shift-escape to exit. Use the blacklist to automatically enter Ignore mode on specific sites.\n\nThere’s also an article on ghacks.net which is a good introduction.","isPlatformCompatible":true,"eula":null,"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/178/178791.png?src=api&modified=1475426382","width":"389","height":"525","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/178/178791.png?src=api&modified=1475426382","thumbnailWidth":"111","thumbnailHeight":"150","caption":"Click things using your keyboard with the help of hint markers.

Your geographic location is obtained through various means (eg. using wifi data) and is often highly accurate, which can be a violation of your privacy.\n\nThis extension allows you to enjoy the useful applications of geolocation while protecting your privacy. It does so by reporting a fake location to websites, obtained by adding a certain amount of \"noise\" to the real location. The noise is randomly selected in a way that ensures that the real location cannot be inferred with high accuracy.\n\nThree configurable privacy levels are provided. The higher the privacy level the greater the amount of noise, which gives better privacy at the expense of a less accurate fake location. This can be configured per-website for flexibility: a more accurate location can be provided for driving directions than for a weather forecast. There's also an option to use a fixed location, instead of adding noise to the real one. This offers the best privacy (no dependence on the real location at all), at the cost of very low accuracy.\n\nNote: your location can be also detected from your IP address, but usually with poor accuracy. Location Guard protects the accurate location revealed through the javascript API.","isPlatformCompatible":true,"eula":null,"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/152/152196.png?src=api&modified=1422927979","width":"640","height":"400","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/152/152196.png?src=api&modified=1422927979","thumbnailWidth":"200","thumbnailHeight":"125","caption":"Location

It will work in Firefox 52 ESR until ESR moves to Firefox 59 in 2018 (~Q2).\n\nWaterfox browser is based on Firefox and will keep legacy add-on support, so CTR will work even after Firefox 57 release.\n\nThere is no \"please port it\" or \"please add support for it\" this time. The entire add-on eco system changes and the technology behind this kind of add-ons gets dropped.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nThis add-on restores squared tabs, the application button with application menu (known from Firefox for Windows), the add-on bar, bookmarks/history menu/sidebar buttons and other buttons. It moves star & feed buttons into location bar, adds status bar element to the ui and allows many items to be movable. All features are fully optional. Some buttons have to be moved to toolbars manually using browsers 'customizing' mode.\n\nMain features (on CTRs preferences window)\n\n    Tab appearance: squared tabs (classic)\n    Tab appearance: curved tabs (all colored and visible)\n    Tabs not on top + [tabsontop=\"false/true\"] attribute\n    Tab width and height settings\n    Tab title in Firefox titlebar\n    Tab loading animations\n    Tab close button on all tabs, active tab, toolbars start/end\n    Restore tabs empty favicon\n    Custom 'new tab' page url (Firefox 41+)\n    Double click on tabs toolbar opens 'new' tab [Windows only]\n    Hide tabs toolbar with one visible tab\n    Custom colors for tab backgrounds, text and text shadow\n    Custom tab separators\n    Application button on toolbars (+ icon variations)\n    Application button on titlebar [Windows only]\n    Custom title for application button on titlebar [Windows only]\n    Predefined/custom application button colors\n    Small navigation toolbar buttons\n    Movable back-forward buttons\n    Alternative appearance for preferences/options page\n    Open preferences/options page in a window (simulates preference window)\n    Alternative add-ons manager appearance (Firefox 40+)\n    Show add-ons version number inside add-ons manager (Firefox 40+)\n    Activity indicator (throbber) on toolbars\n    Bookmarks-star button in location bar\n    Rss-Feed button in location bar\n    Old Search UI (Firefox 43+)\n    Movable status-bar panel\n    Old location bar appearance (Firefox 48+)\n    Additional location bar\n    Combine stop & reload buttons\n    Hide location bars stop, reload & go buttons\n    Hide private browsing mask\n    Findbar on top or bottom\n    'Icons & Text' and 'Text only' modes\n    Add [iconsize=\"large\"]/[iconsize=\"small\"] attributes to #nav-bar node\n    Compact panel menus (bookmarks, history...)\n    Green/blue site identity button for verified websites and secure connections\n    Replace context menu icons with labels (Back, Forward...)\n    Add up to 20 additional toolbars to to top browsers area\n    Replace generic favicon with different icons\n    Favicon of a website in locations bars identity button\n    Different padlock icons for secure connections\n    AeroBlue toolbar colors for Windows 8/XP/Classic, Linux, MacOSX\n    Hide navigation toolbar\n    Inverted/white toolbar button icons\n    Predefined toolbar settings to alter colors, sizes, borders\n    Disable some of browsers default ui animations\n    Force some hidden toolbars to appear in fullscreen mode\n    Remove title/menu/tabs toolbars background color (Windows 10)\n    Disable browsers Loop (chat), Reader & Pocket features\n    ...and more\n\n\nFeatures (not on CTRs preferences window)\n\n    about:preferences keeps last selected category/tab\n    'Add-on Bar' (toolbar context menu)\n    Toggle 'Add-on Bar' using 'Ctrl + /' btw. 'Cmd + /'\n    'Additional Toolbar(s)' (toolbar context menu)\n    Spaces, Flexible spaces, Separators\n    Bookmarks menu & sidebar buttons\n    History menu & sidebar buttons\n    Additional movable reload & stop buttons\n    Movable urlbar container\n    Movable main menu button (three lines)\n    ...and more\n\n\nSquared tabs\nDefault 'curved tabs' can be optionally replaced with classic 'squared tabs'.\nTabs on MacOSX look more like Windows tabs with MacOSX colors on purpose.\n\nCurved alternative tabs\nAll tabs are curved and use colours known from squared tabs.\n\nTabs 'not' on top\nSimulates 'tabs.onTop=false' setting and moves tabs below navigation toolbar. On MacOSX tabs also get a 'reversed appearance'.\n\nApplication button / application menu settings\n\nApplication button on [Firefox] titlebar [Windows only]\nThe titlebar button is fixed on titlebars left like on Firefox since version 4.0. It is enabled by default on Windows systems.\n\nApplication button on toolbars\nOn toolbars the button appears like a default toolbar button.\n\nApplication button colours\nOn titlebar and tabs toolbar the application button can be orange, blue (Aurora), black (Nightly), blue (Palemoon), red, green and gray in normal browsing mode and purple in private browsing mode like on previous Firefox versions.\n\nNote\nThe new appmenu is not an exact copy of the old one, but looks as original as possible. The 'splitmenu' will not be restored and the appmenu popup/submenus also miss some non-replicable menuitems.\n\nSmall navigation toolbar buttons\nNavigation toolbar buttons get alternative margins and paddings to simulate old 'small icon view'.\n\nHide 'Navigation Toolbar'\nHiding navigation toolbar might be interesting after content got moved to other toolbars.\n\n'Add-on Bar'\nA toolbar at the bottom of the window. All movable buttons and items can be placed on it. Add-on bar can be enabled/disabled using toolbars context menu (right-click on a toolbar) or using 'Ctrl + /' (Windows/Linux) btw. 'Cmd + /' (MacOSX).\n\n'Additional Toolbar'\nA toolbar between navigation toolbar and bookmarks toolbar. It can be enabled/disabled using toolbars context menu (right-click on a toolbar).\n\nIcons + text / text only mode\nSimulates old icons + text / text modes where text was displayed below toolbar buttons or button icons got hidden.\n\nBookmarks menu button\nA default 'menu button' which opens the 'classic' bookmarks menu. Positioned on bookmarks toolbar the button also displays its label.\n\nBookmarks and history sidebar buttons\nButtons which toggle bookmarks and history sidebar.\n\nBack-forward, reload and stop buttons\nBrowsers default buttons got merged with urlbar and cannot be moved to different toolbar positions or to different toolbars. CTR adds duplicates of these buttons to the customization palette.\n\nCombined reload-stop button\nPlace reload button AFTER stop button and enable the corresponding option on CTRs preference window. Hovering the option on preference window to get extra information.\nToolbar: [something]...[stop-button][reload-button]...[something]\n\nSpaces, flexible spaces and separators\nThese toolbar items appear in customizing mode and can be moved to toolbars like on previous Firefox versions.\n\nWindows - Linux - MacOSX\nThis add-on was tested on Windows 7 (AeroBasic, AeroGlass, Classic) & 8(.1) & 10 & XP (Classic, Luna-Blue/Silver/Olive, Zune, Royale), Linux Mint KDE, Ubuntu and MacOSX 10.8/10.9/10.10/10.11. On other Systems or non OS-default themes tab colors may look wrong. Bookmarks, history, stop, reload, back and forward toolbar buttons use default OS icons (Firefox Windows icons on Windows systems, Firefox Mac icons on MacOSX and Firefox Linux icons on Linux systems).\n\nInfo, known 'issues', 'glitches', problems\n1) Application menus 'cut', 'copy' and 'paste' buttons do not always work like they should.\n2) Switching between AeroGlass and AeroBasic on Windows 7/Vista can change application buttons position, if the menubar is disabled. Maximizing/restoring browsers main window or restarting Firefox resolves the problem. This glitch is caused by Microsoft Windows and titlebars behavior and not by this add-on.\n3) Entering and leaving customizing mode 'disables' right-click menu items for bookmarks inside bookmarks menu button. A restart resolves this issue.\n4) Tab colors on MacOSX fit to current ui instead of using Firefox 28 colors. This is intended and not a bug.\n5) It is strongly recommended to remove Foxtab and Shareaholic before installing Firefox 29 or newer, because both add-ons break Firefox ui in Fx29+. Using Foxtab and/or Shareaholic with CTR causes even more errors, because CTR allows to move/remove more items than the default Firefox does.\nIf one of these add-ons has corrupted the ui, the add-ons manager has to be accessed via menubar (right-click on a toolbar -> select menubar, Tools -> add-ons) and Shareaholic and Foxtab have to be uninstalled and CTR has to be disabled. After a browser restart, CTR can be enabled again. After another restart \"restore defaults\" in customizing mode has to be hit once.\n\n##############################################\n\nIt is recommended to switch to a clean new profile or at least to trigger \"Restore Defaults\" in customizing mode to avoid UI issues after upgrading from Firefox 28 (and older) to Firefox 29 (and newer).\nProfile Switcher add-on and Profilist add-on can help creating new profiles.\n\n##############################################\n\nAVAST AV software,\"Browser Cleanup\" and disappearing Firefox add-ons\nIf Avasts \"Browser Cleanup\" still accidentally removes Firefox add-ons consider removing or disabling \"Browser Cleanup\" feature.\n\n##############################################\n\ngHacks.net article (10 Reasons why you may want to try

The extension adds a context menu item so you can search for an image to find out where it came from, how it is being used, if modified versions of the image exist, or to find higher resolution versions.","fullDescription":"This is the official TinEye extension for Firefox.\n\nABOUT TINEYE\n\nTinEye is the first image search engine on the web to use image identification technology rather than keywords, metadata or watermarks. When you submit an image to be searched, TinEye creates a unique and compact digital signature or 'fingerprint' for it, then compares this fingerprint to every other image in our index to retrieve matches. TinEye does not typically find similar images; it finds exact matches including those that have been cropped, edited or resized.\n\nTinEye adds tens of millions of new images to its database every week.\nFollow our image updates here: https://tineye.com/releases\n\nFor the latest updates you can also:\n\n- Read the TinEye blog: http://blog.tineye.com/\n- Become a fan on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/tineye\n- Follow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/tineye\n\nHOW TO INSTALL\n\nPlease see our TinEye extensions page.\n\nHOW TO USE THIS ADD-ON\n\nTo use the add-on, simply right-click on any web image and select \"Search image on TinEye\" from the context menu.

Thank You!\"...yes, Mozilla, Nightly 29/Australis is CRAP!!!), then please try Classic Theme Restorer (if you plan on keeping Firefox, lol) or the Pale Moon browser (if you plan on moving to a browser for the USERS not the Firefox DEVS!).\n\n    It's called \"Pale Moon\", but that's just cuz they have to change the name, it's really Firefox before Australis. I have no idea if NoUn Buttons works with it, but I hope so, let me know & I'll try to do what I can to support it...you may need to \"force\" install it or override compatibility.\n\n                ███████████████████ Public Service Announcement ███████████████████\n\n\n███ Dev Version Released ███ Fri, Feb 7, 2014 --- 2/7/14, 1:19:19am EST\n\n    I've uploaded the current development version (1.1.4.2dev20140207011919) to my site. I still need to test the new version on Nightly (Australis), Aurora & Beta.\n\n    Some version will be uploaded to AMO soon/eventually, but it's quicker to just dump it on my site...\n        JSLover.secsrv.net/Addons/NoUn-Buttons\n\n\n    ...surprisingly, there ARE SOME PREFS!!! YAY! It's not finished yet, but it's close. Confirmed to work on Firefox 27. Not tested on Australis yet, should work, but you won't be able to remove Australis's default everything bar...I will write code to help with/fix that.\n\n\n■■■ Info ■■■ I wrote some code! ███ Thu, Jan 23, 2014 --- 1/23/14, 5:19:19pm EST\n\n    I spent a few hours last night writing code & updating NoUn Buttons! Yay! At long last. I still have more updates & testing to do tho.\n\n    Nope, no prefs yet...sorry...I'm not gonna hold up the updates/fixes I CAN write for the one that's been bothering me for years. I want prefs, I really do!\n\n    I plan on uploading whatever I have to the Dev channel ASAP...& uploading the \"real\" next version really soon too!\n        Remember: if you install the Dev channel version (when I upload it), you will be moved to the Dev channel (for this Addon only). To get back off of it, you will need to manually re-install the Main version (to get back on the \"release\" channel). This is an AMO limitation, that I can't control. I wish I could simply push a button & kick any Dev channel users over to the Release channel...or even leave them on the Dev channel, but also feed them the Release version, but I can't.\n\n\n    Hopefully I can help make Australis more tolerable!\n\n    Some of the changes...\n        Fixed: Bug: Error msg \"elem is null\" on all new windows\n        (if you don't have certain buttons on the Toolbars)\n            I'm not sure if this actually caused any problems, but it was highly annoying to see my code do something like that.\n        New Feature: New buttons/widgets: Reload, Stop, Location, Throbber (Activity Indicator)\n            Bringing the list of things provided by NoUn Buttons to...\n                Back Button\n                Forward Button\n                Reload Button\n                Stop Button\n                Location Widget\n                Throbber (Activity Indicator)\n                Back Dropmarker\n                Forward Dropmarker\n                Back/Forward Dropmarker\n            ...let me know if there's anything I missed! (use the support topic!)...I'm coding now, get your request in!\n        Fixed: Bug: Inconsistent amount of Back/Forward history depending on where you are in the list\n            Previously, if you had 39 items in the Back/Forward history (for example) & you were in the dead center (item 19 {counting from 0}), you could only \"see\" 7 back & 7 forward...then, if you went all the way back to item 0, you could see 14 forward. This was a bug & was never intended. It has been fixed by totally rewriting the menu-filling code. Before I was using Firefox's built-in menu-filling code & only \"removing\" what I didn't wanna show. Now I have copied that function & made my own changes to it to only fill the menus with what they need. So you should always have a consistent amount of Back/Forward history -- except, of course, if there REALLY ARE only 3 pages back & 7 pages forward (for example).\n        New Feature: Increased the amount of Back/Forward history displayed to 19.\n            Going along with the above bug-fix. I changed all Back/Forward history menus to display 19 items, cuz I like the number 19!\n\n            Again, once I write ANY pref-handling code, this number (19) WILL be a pref, but since I don't have the code to handle ANY prefs, it's not a pref YET. 19 is a good number, right? It's much better than the 7 back & 7 forward that you used to have!\n\n\n■■■ Info ■■■ Sun, Dec 1, 2013 --- 12/1/13, 1:19:19am EST\n\n    I'm aware of the horrible thing that is called \"Australis\" (aka \"the death of Firefox\")...I really hope I — & all Addon Authors — can overcome the horrible decisions of the Firefox UX Team...& be able to undo \"Australis\". Time will tell.\n\n    I have not personally tried it, but this Addon...\n            Classic Theme Restorer\n\n\n    ...appears to have MANY options for undoing Australis. I highly recommend it. With it, plus my NoUn Buttons, you should be able to hang on & keep using Firefox. I still do wanna fix NoUn Buttons to \"do its thing\" without help from another Addon, but it did work before Firefox messed it up. Firefox keeps merging, Addon Authors keep unmerging. Their most-recent merge of everything is what broken NoUn Buttons in the Nightlies...or not so much \"broke\", since NoUn Buttons does still provide its buttons, but without the ability to remove Firefox's built-in Back/Forward button without also removing the Location bar (a really important widget!)...has caused a \"loss of functionality\", unless you wanna have multiple Back & Forward Buttons, which, you don't.\n\n    Stay tuned. I will update this Description whenever I have even a hacky/temporary workaround. I will update NoUn Buttons when I have new code written that does something cool.\n\n\n■■■ 1.1.4.1 Released ■■■ Fri, Mar 2, 2012 --- 3/2/12, 7:19:19pm EST\n\n    I have released a new version. Version 1.1.4.1\n\n    Some of the changes...\n        Menus are now aligned to the buttons, not the mouse\n            When you right-click on the Back/Forward button (or one of the drop down arrows), the menu is now aligned to the BUTTON, like it was in Firefox 2, instead of displaying the menu on top of the button (wherever your mouse was when you right-clicked). I will make this a pref, so you can turn it off (if desired).\n        Buttons now appear \"down\" when the menu is displayed\n            Like above, in Firefox 2, when you right-clicked one of the buttons that have a menu, the button would appear \"down\", while the menu was displayed. I have re-implemented this effect (it was dirt-simple to do too!). Again, I will make this a pref, so you can turn it off (if desired).\n        The Unified Back/Forward button now has Unmerged Menus/Histories too\n            I have added code that alters the menu of the Merged Back/Forward button, so that it has the same separate histories as the separate buttons. Again, I intend to provide a pref to disable this — actually, I intend to provide a pref for almost everything I implement. I'm not like the Firefox Devs, where I'm scared of adding prefs.\n\n    Known Issues...\n        There are NO preferences, yet\n            Sorry, but I have not written the code to handle any prefs yet.\n        Too many Back & Forward buttons are bad.\n            Putting Firefox's built-in (merged) & NoUn Buttons's (unmerged/separate) Back & Forward buttons on any toolbars (even hidden ones) at the same time is \"bad\" (it causes problems {for unknown reasons}, ironically {did I use that right?}, that's what the screenshots show! — but that was just to show them all on each screenshot). Hoping for fix. For now: \"just don't do that\": remove Firefox's merged crap from ALL/ANY toolbars & add NoUn Buttons to whatever toolbar you want.\n","isPlatformCompatible":true,"eula":null,"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/68/68533.png?src=api&modified=1331246896","width":"519","height":"319","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/68/68533.png?src=api&modified=1331246896","thumbnailWidth":"200","thumbnailHeight":"122","caption":"NoUn Buttons -

Design your browser with your favorite font.","fullDescription":"Theme Font & Size Changer is a simple browser tool that lets you change the font size and font family of Firefox and several other Mozilla products. It is especially valuable tool for visually impaired people and wide screen users.\n\nDifferent from add-ons that enlarge and reduce text on web pages, Theme Font & Size Changer changes the font size and font family in all windows, menus, toolbars, etc within Firefox itself. All font size, font family, and other changes are applied instantly and they are saved permanently and through sessions. You may assign your favorite font into your browser interface and change its size as you wish.\n\nIt was initially created to be an accessibility aid for persons with visual impairments and for those without perfect eyesight, but it's also useful for Firefox users with high resolution settings and wide screens.\n\nWhile Theme Font & Size Changer was written to be used with Firefox default theme, it does work with other non-default themes, but you may come across issues where some elements within Firefox retain the (non-default) font size setting that the theme developer chose for their theme.\n\nThere are two places that you can manage the global font size and font family of Firefox via Theme Font & Size Changer:\n\n    Toolbar Button: Click on the Theme Font & Size Changer button to open up Theme Font & Size Changer settings panel.\n    Tools Option: Choose Tools menu from Firefox Menu Bar and click on the Theme Font & Size Changer option.

You can move it to any toolbar that you wish including the Status Bar by right clicking on a toolbar, selecting Customize, and dragging the icon to the toolbar of your choice. \n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTHUNDERBIRD USERS:\n\n    Statusbar Bar Button: Click on the Theme Font & Size Changer button inside your Thunderbird status-bar.\n    Tools Option: Choose Tools menu from Thunderbird Menu Bar and click on the Theme Font & Size Changer option.

Uses various click, key and click combinations, or keyboard shortcuts to enable quick modifications:\n- Select segment(s) to edit text.\n- Copy, cut or delete segment(s).\n- Delete a segment with all following segments, and reload page, display autocomplete suggestions or open in new tab.\n- Collapse segment(s) to view hidden parts of URL.\n- Break segment(s) into even smaller highlightable fragments for further precise adjustment.\n- Show page load progress of current tab in the Awesome Bar.\n\nDesign Concept\nThis add-on was inspired by a movie. It started from some rustic ideas, and I hope you can somehow find traces of them in this add-on.\n- Legibility: Instead of pursuing the decorative effects to make it look fancy, CSS is used to ease the segment recognization and manipulation.\n- Performance: It doesn't exist, and does not consume cpu cycles while the user is browsing the web and having no interest in the URL. The events listened and the style rules applied are carefully chosen to avoid overhead.\n- Productivity: Every action is initiated and completed by a single click or a single key and click combination. No contextmenu, No stop-and-think and No waste motion of keystroke or mouseclick.\n- Flexibility: It is fully configurable, and user can choose what actions thy need, what modifiers are comfortable to them and how many modifiers they really need.\n\nUsage & Customization\nCheck the screenshots and find the detailed description at the bottom of this page in the Developer’s Comments section.\n\nNote\nCombined use of this add-on with other location bar mod add-on might cause conflict. If this add-on doesn't deliver what it promises to do, please disable the conflict one temporally and retry.\n\nThanks & Kudos\nI'd like to give special thanks to digitalhobo for his contribution to the English instruction and issue analysis.","isPlatformCompatible":true,"eula":null,"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/116/116185.png?src=api&modified=1422146087","width":"700","height":"290","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/116/116185.png?src=api&modified=1422146087","thumbnailWidth":"200","thumbnailHeight":"83","caption":"It shows up when you point over the location bar,\nand the active segment is highlighted."},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/116/116186.png?src=api&modified=1422146087","width":"700","height":"290","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/116/116186.png?src=api&modified=1422146087","thumbnailWidth":"200","thumbnailHeight":"83","caption":"Short Click on a segment will delete all the segments following it, and reload the remaining URL string.

Firefox look and behave like Vim","fullDescription":"Vimperator is in need of collaborators! Help bring vimperator into the age of e10s and WebExtensions!\n\nVimperator is a free browser add-on for Firefox, which makes it look and behave like the Vim text editor. It has similar key bindings and you could call it a modal web browser, as key bindings differ according to which mode you are in. For example, it has a special Hint mode, where you can follow links easily with the keyboard only. Also most functionality is available as commands, typing :back will go back within the current page history, just like hitting the back button in the toolbar.\n\nBut Vimperator is more than just a simple command interface to Firefox — it is a complete development environment as well. If you are a web developer, you can enjoy an interactive JavaScript shell — even with completion support. Or if you want to extend Vimperator, you can easily do that by just dropping a JavaScript file in its plugin directory.\n\nVimperator was initially written by Martin Stubenschrott but has found many other contributors in the meanwhile.\n\nIf there are any issues, please check out our issue tracker https://github.com/vimperator/vimperator-labs/issues and add the issue if it isn't already recorded.\n\n=== Features ===\n\n* Vim-like keybindings (h, j, k, l, gg, G, 0, $, ZZ, , etc.)\n* Ex commands (:quit, :open www.foo.com, ...)\n* Tab completion available for all commands with support for 'longest' matching when set in 'wildmode'\n* Extensions! Yes, you can extend Vimperator's functionality with scripts just like you can extend Firefox with extensions.\n* Explore JavaScript objects with :echo window and even context-sensitive tab completion.\n* Hit-a-hint like navigation of links (start with f to follow a link)\n* Advanced completion of bookmark and history URLs (searching also in title, not only URL)\n* Vim-like statusline with a wget-like progress bar\n* Minimal GUI (easily hide useless menubar and toolbar with :set guioptions=)\n* Ability to :source JavaScript files, and to use a ~/.vimperatorrc file\n* Easy quick searches (:open foo will search for \"foo\" in google, :open ebay terminator will search for \"terminator\" on ebay) with support for Firefox keyword bookmarks and search engines\n* Count supported for many commands (3 will go back 3 pages)\n* Beep on errors\n* Marks support (ma to set mark 'a' on a webpage, 'a to go there)\n* QuickMarks support (quickly go to previously marked web pages with go{a-zA-Z0-9})\n* :map and :command support (and feedkeys() for script writers)\n* :time support for profiling\n* Move the text cursor and select text with vim keys and a visual mode.\n* External editor support\n* Macros to replay key strokes\n* AutoCommands to execute action on certain events\n* A comprehensive :help, explaining all commands, mappings and options.\n* Much more...","isPlatformCompatible":true,"eula":null,"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/58/58919.png?src=api&modified=1307285716","width":"568","height":"525","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/58/58919.png?src=api&modified=1307285716","thumbnailWidth":"162","thumbnailHeight":"150","caption":"Hints allow to follow links with the keyboard"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/58/58920.png?src=api&modified=1307285716","width":"568","height":"525","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/58/58920.png?src=api&modified=1307285716","thumbnailWidth":"162","thumbnailHeight":"150","caption":"Vimperator's completion system"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/58/58921.png?src=api&modified=1307285716","width":"568","height":"525","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/58/58921.png?src=api&modified=1307285716","thumbnailWidth":"162","thumbnailHeight":"150","caption":"Exploring the DOM of the web page"}],"averageRating":5,"learnmoreURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/vimperator/?src=api","homepageURL":"http://www.vimperator.org/","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/582324/vimperator-3.16.0-fx.xpi?src=api","size":465385,"developerComments":null,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/vimperator/reviews/?src=api","reviewCount":233,"totalDownloads":890838,"weeklyDownloads":2235,"dailyUsers":15564,"updateDate":1487370928000,"supportURL":"http://www.vimperator.org"},{"id":"langpack-en-ZA@firefox.mozilla.org","icons":{"32":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/6/6180-32.png?modified=1358351591","64":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/6/6180-64.png?modified=1358351591"},"name":"English (South African) Language Pack","type":"locale","version":"56.0","repositoryStatus":4,"creator":{"name":"Dwayne Bailey","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/dwayne-bailey/?src=api"},"developers":[{"name":"Translate.org.za","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/translateorgza/?src=api"},{"name":"Mozilla","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/mozilla/?src=api"}],"description":"Adds South African English language support to the Firefox browser.

The close icon doesn't come in a large icon and small icon size, so it wouldn't look right for users who don't set \"use small icons\" on their toolbars.\n---\nBecause of the way Firefox is designed, Back IS Close can't trap the special keyboard/mouse Back key. If you have an IntelliMouse or similar, configure it to send Alt-Left Arrow rather than Back to make Back IS Close work with the mouse.","reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/back-is-close/reviews/?src=api","reviewCount":44,"totalDownloads":66724,"weeklyDownloads":53,"dailyUsers":445,"updateDate":1445135763000,"supportURL":null}]}
